# Bowery Demo App #

## Live Site ##
You can see the site running at `https://d2pooavy3to05b.cloudfront.net`


## To Run ##
To run my code, make sure you have npm (I am running `6.1.0`).
Then, at the same level as `package.json`,
run `npm install`
and then `npm start`

Just a heads up, I mocked the API's using localStorage, and photos can be fairly space-intensive to store in localStorage. Running the app in *Private Mode* on your phone browser frees up some space! Please make sure you are in *Private Mode*if the add new photo feature is not working.

## Usage Instructions ##
* New Plant - click on camera icon in top right corner
* Search - You can filter photos by plant type and/or plant age (or just see all plants)



## Future Improvements ##
* Annotations
* Swipe through photos in your search to quickly go through all plants that match your criteria
* Responsiveness -- more testing on desktop and ipads etc...
